					Monika Szucs started creating Connectee since September 2016. 
					<br><br>
					Before we get into that, let get into a bit of a background about her. She has always been passionate about doing 
					YouTube videos. Throughout her time on Youtube she has met a lot of people around the world. The only problem 
					was it was hard to find people locally to collaborate with. She tried joining Facebook groups and other chat 
					forms online but it seemed like no one was truely passionate about what they do on Youtube. She hoped that someday
					She could join some kind of a group that could ocnnect people locally easliy and on the go.
					<br><br>
					Then in September of 2016 she joined the Digital Design and Development Diploma program at BCIT. This program
					consisted of web development, business, ethics/law, and design coureses. Throughout her program one of the 
					assignment was to create a business. That is when she decided to create Connectee. 
					<br><br>
					She first created the website for Connectee. this website contained all the information to inform current and 
					potential users. Alongside, when you are logged into Connectee you can acess the dashboard. Which is where you can 
					create and help out with projects. 
					<br><br>
					She eventually plans to create an app which will be dedicated to helping users find projects to help out with on 
					the go. These apps might be a while until it comes out because she has many projects going on. However, she is 
					constantly trying her best and triyng to improve herself and Connectee to help everyone out there.
					<br><br>
					She hopes that this company will be successful and help everyone out there. She is open to any suggestions which 
					you can ask by going to the contacts page to let the company know what improvements should be made.
